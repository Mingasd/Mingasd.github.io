Welcome
=======

I think many blog themes are over designed, so I created this one. 

Just for using, not showing off.

Nice Blog  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green.svg)](https://github.com/gabriel-chen/Nice_Blog)  [![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/gabriel-chen/Nice_Blog.svg)](https://github.com/gabriel-chen/Nice_Blog/releases)
========

A Simple Jekyll Blog Theme.

[Demo](http://gabriel-chen.github.io/Nice_Blog)

![index-page](https://i.imgur.com/BrmOMmv.png)

Introduce yourself in `About` page  :
![about-page](https://i.imgur.com/vRGFclV.png)

And you can turn on or off your skills tree in `_config.yml` :  
![skills-tree](https://i.imgur.com/ssSOj57.png)

Posts will be listed by year in `Archive` page:  
![archive-page](https://i.imgur.com/8bQZtkD.png)

Posts will be listed by category in `Category` page:  
![category-page](https://i.imgur.com/cRHuAWi.png)

Posts will be listed by tag in `Tags` page:

You can put your `PGP` publickey in `Contact` page:
![contact-page](https://i.imgur.com/8wHb5lX.png)

Now you have a `404` page and it will jump back to `index` page itself:

How to use
=========

![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gabriel-chen/Nice_Blog.svg?style=social&&label=Star) it, ![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/gabriel-chen/Nice_Blog.svg?style=social&&label=Fork) it, and Download it.

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gabriel-chen/Nice_Blog.git
```

Change the settings in `_config.yml` file and then you can use this theme.

Then change whatever you want. But first, you should know what you are doing. 

If you messed it up, do not worry, just come back and clone it again.

Have fun.
